# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) for logging in and signing up and [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for styling.

Some features I would add in the future are:

- form validation
- testing
- error handling

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

### `yarn eject`
